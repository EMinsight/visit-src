// Class: QvisWindowBase
//
// Purpose:
//   This is the base class for all windows in the VisIt gui. It
//   provides a few features that all windows need. It inherits a lot
//   of useful messaging routines and a viewer pointer from GUIBase.
//
// Notes:      
//
// Programmer: Brad Whitlock
// Creation:   Wed Aug 30 18:19:35 PST 2000
//
// Modifications:
//   Brad Whitlock, Thu Apr 19 10:36:13 PDT 2001
//   Added overrides of showMinimized and showNormal methods.
//
//   Brad Whitlock, Fri Mar 21 10:30:05 PDT 2003
//   I added ProcessOldVersions.
//
//   Brad Whitlock, Wed Sep 10 09:28:22 PDT 2003
//   I added FitToScreen.
//
//   Mark C. Miller, Wed Nov 16 10:46:36 PST 2005
//   Added StringToDoubleList utility which was duplicated in other gui classes
